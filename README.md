# HCF-Simulation
Code for hollow core fiber pulse propagation in Neon
Solving the nonlinear like schroedinger equation in 1 dimension (time,frequency) with Fourier split step + Runge Kutta method 
Included effects: Self phase modulation, Group velocity dispersion, Cross phase modulation, Ionization, Attenuation, Self steepening and Group velocity mismatch between the 2 pulses
